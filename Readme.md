## üìñ Overview
Thirukkural AI uses the power of AI-driven semantic search and natural language processing to help users connect ancient Tamil wisdom with modern life. It combines a vector database with a large language model (LLM) to find and explain Thirukkural couplets based on user queries in Tamil or English.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Bilingual Support**: Ask questions and receive answers in both Tamil and English.
- **Semantic Search**: Uses advanced vector embeddings to find the most relevant Thirukkural for your query.
- **Personalized Explanations**: AI-generated explanations that connect ancient wisdom to your specific context.
- **Practical Advice**: Receive personalized guidance based on Thirukkural's principles.
- **Rich Context**: Access original text, traditional explanations, and modern interpretations.
- **Clean Frontend**: Built with Next.js for a seamless and modern UI experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit / Next.js (React Framework)
- **Backend**: Python, Groq API (using LLaMA-3-70B versatile model)
- **Vector Database**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers (paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Vercel / Netlify (optional)

## üì¶ Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Groq API Key
- Internet connection for API calls

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nithish3115/Thirukkural_Ai_Assistant.git
cd Thirukkural_Ai_Assistant
```

### Set up the Python Backend
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a .env file and set your Groq API key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Run the backend:
```bash
python app.py
```

### Set up the Next.js Frontend
Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the Next.js development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## üîç How It Works

### Vector Database Creation
Generates multilingual vector embeddings for 1330 Thirukkural verses and their explanations using a sentence transformer model.

### Query Processing
Converts the user's question into the same vector space and searches for semantically similar matches.

### Relevance Ranking
Uses the Groq LLM to evaluate and rank potential matches, selecting the most relevant Thirukkural verse.

### Response Generation
The LLM generates AI-powered explanations and advice based on the selected Thirukkural, relating ancient wisdom to your modern query.
