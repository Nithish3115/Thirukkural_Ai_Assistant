Project Title:
Futuristic Thirukkural AI – Multimodal Web Experience

Objective:
Build a stunning futuristic AI-powered React web app that enables users to search, listen to, and explore the Thirukkural in both Tamil and English using vector-based search (FAISS) and pickle-based knowledge storage. The app should provide an immersive user experience with modern UI animations, interactive elements, and audio narration.

Features & Functionality:
🔍 Advanced AI-Powered Search
Use FAISS vector search to find relevant Thirukkural verses in Tamil and English based on user queries.

Display highly relevant search results with an elegant, animated UI.

🎙 Audio Playback & Narration
Integrate a text-to-speech (TTS) feature to play the selected Thirukkural in both Tamil and English.

Use a futuristic sound design for playback controls (smooth animations, glowing effects).

🌟 Futuristic UI/UX Design
Aesthetic & modern UI: Use Glassmorphism / Neumorphism / Cyberpunk themes with smooth animations.

Dynamic elements: Animated search results, interactive buttons, and AI-generated background visuals.

📜 Thirukkural Knowledge Base
Load and manage Thirukkural data from a pickle file (thirukkural_data.pkl).

Display each verse beautifully with its meaning and explanation.

📡 Live AI Responses & Chat
Implement a React-based chatbot UI where users can chat with an AI assistant to explore Thirukkural philosophy.

🌍 Language Support
Dual-language UI (Tamil & English) with a toggle option.

🖼 Responsive & Cross-Platform
Ensure the app works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile with smooth animations.

Tech Stack & Tools:
🏗 Backend (Python, FastAPI / Flask)
Utilize the existing Python script (app.py) as the backend for FAISS vector search.

Expose endpoints for search, retrieval, and audio playback.

💻 Frontend (React + TailwindCSS / Three.js for Futuristic UI)
Next.js / Vite for a fast React app.

Use Framer Motion / GSAP for smooth animations.

Implement Three.js for immersive AI-generated visuals.

🔊 Audio (TTS Integration)
Integrate Google TTS / ElevenLabs AI Voice API for realistic narration.

📂 Data Storage
FAISS database for efficient vector search.

Pickle file (thirukkural_data.pkl) for verse retrieval.

⚡ Additional Enhancements
Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle.

ChatGPT-powered Thirukkural explanations for deep insights.

Development Steps for Replit AI:
Analyze app.py to understand its FAISS and pickle-based data retrieval.

Set up a FastAPI backend for processing queries and serving results.

Build a React frontend with futuristic animations and AI integration.

Integrate text-to-speech (TTS) for audio playback.

Optimize for a fast, interactive experience using modern design principles.

Final Deliverable:
A fully functional, futuristic, and mesmerizing Thirukkural AI Web App that provides:
✅ AI-powered search with vector embeddings.
✅ Dual-language support (Tamil & English).
✅ Text-to-Speech playback for Thirukkural narration.
✅ Modern, immersive UI with animations.
✅ Chatbot for philosophical AI conversations.

This app should feel like a next-gen AI-powered knowledge experience, making Thirukkural exploration engaging, beautiful, and insightful! 🚀

Execution Instructions for Replit AI:
Run the existing app.py to verify the FAISS search works.

Set up a FastAPI/Flask backend with search endpoints.

Develop a futuristic React frontend with animations.

Integrate TTS API for audio playback.

Ensure cross-platform responsiveness.
